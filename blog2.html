      Vintage clothing has become more and more popular over the past decade.
      Underneath obvious markers like the launch of brands RRL, or artificially aged sneakers, men have been gradually
      buying into vintage because it’s authentic, because it’s a way to buy old styles that are suddenly trendy, and
      just as importantly, because it’s cheap.
      I’ve bought vintage off-and-on for most of that time. Initially leather goods, then military clothing, and more
      recently outerwear. I wrote a post earlier this week about one piece, an M47 Parka.
      However, I’m a real beginner when it comes to buying vintage. So I turned to three friends to get their advice,
      providing tips for any readers venturing into vintage clothing.

      What general advice would you have for someone buying or collecting vintage for the first time?
    </h4>
    <p class="blog-text">
      Most importantly, buy things that you want to wear rather than as collector’s pieces. You’re looking to fill the
      holes in your wardrobe and/or find a superior quality version of something current, so buy things that are
      practical and wearable.
      Some people look at me shocked if I’m wearing a jacket they know to be particularly rare or special rather than
      keeping it hermetically sealed in my house, but I’m building a wardrobe, not a museum.
    </p>
    <h4 class="blog-text">
      How wary should someone be of variations in pricing, eg something being trendy and therefore suddenly much more
      expensive? Is that something that affects what you buy?
    </h4>
    <img src="./assets/blog3-image3.jpg" alt="" class="image-blog">
    <p class="blog-text">
      Again, just don’t let that affect your decision making too much. There will always be mini-trends on the vintage
      market and things fall in and out of favour, so look more for quality, fit and value.
      Pricing will ultimately be directed by scarcity, but there’s plenty of scope to still buy cheap.
      If you take the classic Vietnam-era US Army “Jungle Jacket”, the much-copied staple, a first pattern was issued in
      the late 50s when there were less than 1000 US troops “in country”. Therefore the numbers in circulation were
      minuscule compared to the fourth pattern issued in 1968, when there were over half a million US soldiers stationed
      there.
      A deadstock 4th pattern should set you back £50 or so. A first pattern? Good luck.
      Is it OK to alter vintage clothing to fit, or is that undermining the point of it?
      I mean, that is entirely up to you. The reason I buy vintage, however, is often for a specific fit. Unfortunately
      when a lot of current brands bring out their take on military vintage, they “modernise” the fit, particularly
      slimming down the silhouette.
      That aside, I do like finding pieces that people modified contemporaneously, adding another level of personality
      to the item.
      The other reason I buy vintage is for fabric choice. There’s just a different feel to worn in cloths, especially
      cottons. As the fibres in poplin or “Cramerton” chino cloth, for example, break down they gain an incredible
      handle and texture that you cannot replicate.
