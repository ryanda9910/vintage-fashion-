            Wioleta Shaw is the pin-up star of our favourite Vintage and Retro Instagram account, @inthepurpleworld. Her
            vintage-inspired outfits, hair and makeup fuse 1940s nostalgia with modern day fashion. We discovered
            Wioleta's 'Old World Styling' as the perfect canvas for our Quintessence Amber Jewellery Collection, which
            boasts a fusion of classic design, historic gemstones and modern metals.

            1. FIND YOUR STYLE
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
            "Discover the decade from which your style belongs and go for it. With vintage you have pretty much a
            century's worth of fashion:
            Posh & Puffy 1900s.
            The Flirty 1920s
            Business Beauty 1930s
            Sexy & Classy 1940s
            Cute Rockabilly 1950s
            Hippy Chic 1960s
            Whether its the lowered waist, pearls and feathers of the roaring 20s, the simple and practical beauty of
            the 50s, or the pencil dresses and shoulder pads of the 30s - there are so many opportunities to play with.
            So choose your decade and go for it."

            2. EMBRACE IT, DON'T OVERDO IT
        </h3>
        <img src="./assets/image-blog3-3.png" alt="" class="image-blog">
        <p class="blog-text">
            "When you've discovered your Vintage Style - embrace it but don't overdo it. You want to look vintage chic,
            not like you're taking part in a historical reenactment. This leads on nicely to my next point"
        </p>
        </h4>
        <h3 class="sub-titte">
            3. ADD A MODERN TWIST
        </h3>
        <img src="./assets/image-blog3-4.png" alt="" class="image-blog">
        <p class="blog-text">
            Always add something modern to your look. If your entire outfit and accessories are vintage, don't add a
            puddle hairstyle, instead, leave your hair in a ponytail. If your hair and clothes are vintage-inspired, opt
            for a pair of converse or ballerinas to tone down the look. Balance is key with vintage fashion.
        </p>
        </h4>
        <h3 class="sub-titte">
            4. ACCESSORIES ARE KING
        </h3>
        <img src="./assets/image-blog3-5.png" alt="" class="image-blog">
        <p class="blog-text">
            Even a simple shift dress from Zara can look Vintage if you mix it up with the right accessories. Don't be
            afraid to dress up your 'modern' clothes with retro-chic handbags, shoes and of course, jewellery.
            </h4>
            <h3 class="sub-titte">
                5. BE YOURSELF
            </h3>
            <img src="./assets/image-blog3-6.png" alt="" class="image-blog">
            <p class="blog-text">
                "Never forget to be yourself and embrace it. Vintage and retro fashion will always catch people's
                attention. If you don't feel good, it can quickly become intimidating. Vintage should be fun, playful
                and a creative way to express yourself. Embrace the attention that you'll receive and feel good about
                the skin and clothes you're in."
